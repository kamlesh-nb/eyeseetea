So let's start off our first lesson about the power of three, which is the open-high-low-close and the open-low-high-close of a candle. 

Now, what is open-high-low-close and open-low-high-close? We also call this the power of three, right? It involves the accumulation, manipulation, and distribution of a certain type of candle. Understanding the open-high-low-close or the open-low-high-close of a candle is crucial in everything from daily bias to entries. It's a foundational understanding to my trading, and the concept is fairly simple yet highly effective.

We all know the daily candle opens up at 5:00 p.m. EST and closes at 5:00 p.m. EST. However, we are going to use this understanding from 12:00 a.m. EST to 12:00 a.m. EST, which is the true day open. We call it the true day open because this is where the algorithm starts its true day.

Right, so we're going to be talking about five candle formations. We're going to be talking about a bullish candle, a bullish reversal candle, a bearish candle, a bearish reversal candle, and then at the end, about a consolidation candle, which is incisional.

Over here, we've got a bullish candle and a bullish reversal candle. A bullish candle is an open-low-high-close. Let's outline that over here: we open up the day, make a low, continue to expand during the day creating the high of the day, and then close out eventually. 

Now, most of the time when we have these types of candles, the London session or London Kill Zone creates the low of the day, and then we expand higher during London and have a New York retracement into a continuation. 

With a bullish reversal, we have a longer wick on the bottom, right? So we have an open, and this longer wick on the bottom can be comprised of a sell-side liquidity run on the higher time frame, thus having a reversal and then continuing to expand higher and closing at the end of the day.

Over here, we've got two bearish candles. We've got a bearish candle and a bearish reversal candle. A bearish candle is an open-high-low-close. So over here, we open up, create the high of the day, expand lower during the day, and eventually close out the day down here, thus having a bearish candle.

Now again, just like with the bullish candles, the high of the day can be formed during the London session most of the time, expanding and having a New York continuation to close out the day bearish. 

With a bearish reversal candle, we can see again we have a longer wick on the top this time. This longer wick can be a buy-stop raid, or we can hit a higher time frame bearish premium array, like a higher time frame fair value gap or order block, causing a reversal for the day, continuing down lower and expanding lower until we close out the day bearish.

Finally, that incisional candle. The name already says this, right? The candle has no idea where it wants to go, leaving a relative equal top wick and a relative equal lower wick, and looks kind of like a doji.

Over here, we've got a British Pound/US Dollar daily chart. We've outlined our premium and discount levels. From this discount low into this discount high, we can see these candles forming. Up on top of this, buy stops, right? 

Then what do we have over here? We've got a bullish order block. So when we're looking at a bullish candle, we're seeing a low created over here, expansion higher, taking out those buy stops and eventually closing out the day bullish.

But how does that look like on an intraday chart? We've got an intraday chart for the British Pound and the US Dollar 15-minute chart. We've got that higher time frame POI over here, that bullish order block. 

Now, where do we create the low of the day? Below that New York midnight open price. Let's outline that over here, draw out that New York midnight opening price, 12:00 a.m. EST. The low of the day is being formed down here during the London session. 

A lot of times, we form the low of the day during the London session, and that makes trading New York a little bit easier. I will explain later in this mentorship why. 

Over here, we've got that daily candle, right? We open up, create a lower wick, and then expand for the rest of the day with a bullish daily candle. Low of the day, London session, New York retracement into continuation until we reach that buy-side liquidity target and close out the day over here, leaving this as a bullish candle.

Over here, we've got a Euro/USD daily chart. Where are our discount and premium levels? We go from this low until this high. The 50% level is in discount. Now, over here, we know if we're dropping lower and lower, we're going into discount levels. Are we hitting a higher time frame PDRA? Yes, we've got that daily fair value gap.

So we're going to be talking about a bullish reversal candle right now, and we can already see it's forming down here. Why are we reversing? Because we took out sell-side liquidity and then we're hitting a higher time frame discount array.

Now, how does that look like on an intraday chart? Again, we have a 15-minute chart for Euro/USD. We're hitting that higher time frame POI, right? We took out all that sell-side liquidity and outline this with more annotations. 

Again, always outline your New York midnight opening price. That is the true day open of the algorithm. We want to be buyers below this line, and we want to be sellers ideally above this line.

So over here, we've got an incisional London session. Probably some high-impact news later in the day could be possible. With the New York session, we drop lower, creating the low of the day in New York. We run all that sell-side liquidity, hitting a higher time frame PD, that discount fair value gap, and then having a New York reversal profile for today.

You can see this longer wick because we opened over here, right? Actually, if we take a daily candle, we open at 5:00 p.m., but that longer wick is because we dive deep down below that New York midnight open line and then close out the day higher up, leaving this longer wick, thus having a bullish reversal day.

Over here, we've got a Euro/USD daily chart. We've got an old high up here, external range liquidity buy stops over here have been purged. After we run buy-side over here, it's likely that we have a bearish day afterwards to fill up an imbalance, for instance, this imbalance down here.

So how does that look like on an intraday chart? We've got this Euro/USD 15-minute chart. We ran buy stops above this red line, right? We are having a bearish day afterwards. How does that look like with more annotations? 

High of the day during the London session. Most of the time, the London session creates the high or low of the day before a higher time frame P has been hit. Draw out your daily opening price. Over here, we see we trade and accumulate sell stops above here, taking out these buy stops. You can see on the daily candle, it looks something like this: an upper wick has been formed, and the rest of the day will expand lower and lower during New York. We have a retracement into premium levels and then continue down lower until we reach our closing price, forming this daily bearish candle.

Now, let's talk about a bearish reversal candle. Why does it reverse? Most of the time, we hit a higher time frame PD, or we run buy stops or sell stops. In this occasion, we've got these buy stops up here being run, and then we see this longer wick down and closing the day out bearish.

How does that look like on a 15-minute chart, an intraday chart? As always, draw out your New York midnight opening line. Draw it out in time all the way to the right for the close of the day. With this longer wick on top, we need to have an expansion higher first, right? So we're expanding higher first, having a New York session reversal profile, we run buy stops on our higher time frame, and then start to decline after, closing out the day over here, forming this bearish candle.

So think about it, right? Accumulation, manipulation up higher into those buy stops, and then distribution lower. That's the power of three of a daily candle.

Now, let's talk about a consolidation candle or an incisional candle. The market obviously has to be in a consolidation. The market has no clue where it wants to go next, thus creating an incisional candle.

How does that look like on an intraday chart? You can already see it when we draw out that New York midnight opening price. It's just straight up, up, down, up, down, up, down, right? We're creating a high of the day, going back to that New York midnight opening price, creating a low of the day, and then just keep hanging around that New York midnight opening price. This is an indication of a consolidation day. 

You can also say it's kind of a seek and destroy profile because we just run buy stops and sell stops, returning back into the range. On the daily candle, it looks something like this as an incisional candle.
