The next topic we're going to cover is internal and external range liquidity. This lesson is going to be the turning point for most of you. This is what makes buyers easy. You really want to get your notepad out for this one, guys. Understanding the relationship between these types of liquidity will unlock your ability to read price action.

Also, very important, backtest as always. We're talking about time frame alignment. We're talking about monthly levels into a daily structure. We're going to be using weekly levels into a 4-hour structure. We can use a daily level into a 1-hour structure. Price is fractal, right? So, understanding external to internal, we can use these different types of levels on the monthly, weekly, and daily levels and use their corresponding structure on the daily, 4-hour, and 1-hour.

The relationship between internal and external range liquidity and how they interact is the key turning point in really understanding where the market is likely to draw to. I consider this lesson one of the most important, if not the most important, in the mentorship. So grab your notepad, guys. Make notes and backtest. The understanding you will learn between these two is the foundation for building the anticipatory skills for price movements and understanding where the market is likely to draw to.

### Internal and External Range Liquidity

Now, what is internal and what is external range liquidity?

- **Internal range liquidity (IRL)** is defined by fair value gaps (imbalances) on your chart.
- **External range liquidity** is defined by old highs and old lows.

When external range liquidity is taken, a fair value gap becomes the next draw on liquidity. When a fair value gap is stacked, an old low or an old high (external range liquidity) becomes the next draw.

We have a crude schematic over here on how to see where internal and where external range liquidity is. We've got this move up starting from here, so we have external range over here, which is an old low. We move up, going down, down, down, taking out that low, so that is external range liquidity because there's an old low down here.

Price only does two things: it goes to old highs and old lows or seeks to reprice into imbalances. So, in this range where we draw lower from, there was a fair value gap or an imbalance up higher. Price took out external range liquidity. So, what is the next thing price will do? Price will draw to internal next, which is that fair value gap.

Think about it. When you see an old high or an old low get raided, you want to either look for an imbalance inside that range to get repriced into. Then, once that gets hit, we can move for the next one, which is external again.

Same over here, only reversed. We have external range liquidity over here, as in an old high. Price moves lower, forms a swing low, expands up higher, taking out that external range liquidity. In the process of taking out that external range or old high over here, we form an imbalance down here, which could be a fair value gap. Then price moves back into that fair value gap after taking out external range liquidity. Then, when we hit that internal range, we want to go for external again.

As explained earlier, price only does two things: it draws to old highs and old lows and it rebalances an imbalance. There's literally nothing else price does. With that in mind, it becomes very clear after you see old highs or old lows getting raided, what are we going to look for next? We're going to look for an imbalance where we can trade into.

Let's say we are in bearish order flow and we take out an old low. There's probably a fair value gap in a premium level on that same structure. We can look to trade and buy into that old low. After that old low has been raided, we can buy into that fair value gap. Once that fair value gap hits and it respects it, we can look for external range again. 

The flow of the marketplace is that internal range liquidity being tagged will be the catalyst for price to draw to external range liquidity and vice versa. External range liquidity being taken is the catalyst for price to draw to internal range. It's only this, and it repeats. As simple as that, after time, after time, it repeats like this: external to internal, internal to external.

Using this understanding on the monthly, weekly, daily, and 4-hour is the key you've all been looking for when it comes to daily bias.

### Australian Dollar/US Dollar Monthly Chart Example

Alright, we've got an Australian Dollar/US Dollar monthly chart over here. Let's look at where the monthly external range liquidity is. Right, so we rate this external range. Now, without going further, where does your eye draw into? You should be looking at an internal range liquidity in the form of a fair value gap. After external gets rated, where do we want to reach into? We can see this imbalance down here, which is a fair value gap. If you looked at this area after we got this external range liquidity rated, you're on the right path. We can see this monthly internal range liquidity in the form of a fair value gap gets stacked.

Now, what happens afterwards? Let's look at this from a daily perspective. We take out a monthly external range liquidity. Now, using daily structure to frame our setups, what are we going to be waiting for after this monthly external range liquidity has been taken? We're going to look for a monthly internal range to be the drawn liquidity. We have this outlined down here. Now, we need to wait for a little bit of confirmation as always. So, we wait for a break of structure that happens after we rate the monthly external, break of structure down here, return back into premium, and it continues down into that fair value gap.

### GBP/AUD Weekly Chart Example

Alright, we've got a GBP/AUD weekly chart over here. Again, let's look at it from here. Weekly external range liquidity has been taken. Where is your eye drawing to? Do we see any imbalances down here? Nope. Where do we see an imbalance? Right down here. So, with that imbalance being present down here, this fair value gap, your eyes should immediately go there for the next draw on liquidity. External range has been taken, so what are we going to look for next? Internal range, right? Weekly internal range liquidity over here, and it draws in there perfectly.

Now, we've hit that weekly internal range liquidity. Think about it: external to internal. Now we're in internal. Where are we going to draw into next? Where is your eye going? External range liquidity over here. It's as simple as that. External has been rated over here. We draw back into internal. Internal has been tagged. Where are we going to go? We're going to go to external. It's as simple as that.

So, that weekly external range liquidity, that old high, has been liquidated. After going into internal and looking at the daily chart, now we can see how we can frame our bias on the daily. So, this was the draw on liquidity. We're drawing lower, lower, lower, right, and then hitting that weekly internal range liquidity. So, we went from external, remember, back to internal. Now we've hit that internal range liquidity, going into a market maker buy model. This is the sell side of the curve over here, then we're going into the buy side of the curve over here because we hit a higher time frame discount array, right, the fair value gap. Now we're going to reach for external range liquidity, and the first external range liquidity, which is very obvious, is this long wick here. So, we're going to eye up this liquidity, which is also a break of structure, after we hit that higher time frame array.

Now, when the market displaces over here, we have internal range liquidity formed, right? So again, we go from external over here, where do we want to go? We have internal, right, back into internal. And after we hit that internal, where do we want to go? External again, right? So, we have this old high up here, which is external range liquidity. And you might think, but wait a minute, I thought this was external range liquidity. But in this whole bigger range, every swing high or swing low is external range liquidity. And remember, internal range liquidity will be that fair value gap we're looking to mitigate with and continue up.

### Further Examples and Summary

So, same case over here. We take out this external range liquidity again. Where are we going to go? Do we see any fair value gaps? Yes, we have this one, and we have a fair value gap down here. But why are we not taking this fair value gap? This has something to do with premium discount. If you take this range low to this range high, this fair value gap is in premium, so it's more likely it will draw into this discount fair value gap. Keep that in mind. The market draws to that internal fair value gap in discount of this range swing low to swing high, continues up again. Where are we going to go after we take this internal range? It's on repeat, right? External to internal to external to internal, and it keeps going and going. Again, external range liquidity over here. After we take that internal range, we went from this internal on a higher time frame, right, that weekly internal range liquidity as the fair value gap. Now we're on a daily chart, and we can see day after day, we're looking for external to internal to external to internal. Again, back into external.

Now we've hit that external, that extreme high up here. What do we want to do? We want to go back into an imbalance again, right? There's another imbalance down here in the fair value gap. It keeps on going into

 internal and then draws back into external. So literally, it's external to internal to external on repeat. Again, external, and then all the annotations together, you can see how this is forming. Think about that extreme high we're going to, and this high we rated an external range liquidity over here, remember. So we're drawing into a weekly internal level. Weekly internal level is down here, right, that fair value gap. Now we're looking for a buy program, buy side of the curve. We're going to an external range here, back to internal to external to internal, and so on.

Knowing the relationship between the two is what leads us to a high probability daily bias. You can see how many intraday opportunities we just had with the understanding of the relationship between internal and external range liquidity.

### USD Dollar Index Daily Chart Example

Alright, we've got a USD Dollar Index daily chart again. Example after example, and this is what you need to see. You need to train your eyes for external to internal to external, and it will make your reading of bias a lot better. Sometimes you don't know what is the draw on liquidity, but using external to internal and internal to external will make it a little easier and, might I say, more accurate. Over here, external range liquidity again. What do we do after we take external range liquidity? We want to go to internal range, right? So, where is internal range liquidity? We've got this big fair value gap up here. Price reprices back into that imbalance over here. So, we hit that internal range liquidity. What do we want to do after we take internal range liquidity? Go back to external, right? We fill this up, we look for this external range liquidity down here, and we keep declining, declining, declining. We take out this external range. Where are we going to draw into next? You might have guessed it already. We're going to internal again, right? You can see it draw lower, going back into internal down here, keep declining, taking out a low. There's no imbalance anymore over here, so price has issues going up way higher than here, and it just keeps declining, taking out this external range liquidity. Now we took external range liquidity, do we see an imbalance anywhere where we can reprice into? Yes, we have over here. We have this daily fair value gap, internal range liquidity.

### British Pound/Swiss Franc Daily Chart Example

We've got a British Pound/Swiss Franc daily chart over here. Again, example after example, keep repeating this. Down here, external range liquidity, old swing low over here. Might I add, we have a rejection block here, this long-wicked area over here, which is pretty deep in discount. Don't forget about your discount and premium levels, which is this whole range, right? So we're pretty deep in discount. We rate a swing low, which is external range liquidity. Now, where does your eye draw into? We have this candle's low to this candle's high forming a fair value gap up here. Price draws in there after we take external range liquidity. Now, what are we going to do after we take this internal range liquidity? You've guessed it, we're probably going to go into external range once again.

Looking at a 1-hour chart makes the structure look a little easier to read. We have a clear sell side of the curve over here, leaving that fair value gap on the daily time frame. After we take out this external range liquidity, we can actually see with the 1-hour chart, it starts to break up and starts to break structure up here, break of structure, return back into discount levels, repricing this internal range liquidity. External over here, back to internal, continuing up, up, up, taking out external. Where are we going next? Back to internal, fair value gap down here, and then we're going to go for external again, which is this daily fair value gap. We went to external on a 1-hour chart, and on the daily, it's an internal range.

For some of you, it's going to be easier to spot than for somebody else, but in my experience, I found it most easy to see external range to internal range first. So, we wait for an old high or an old low to get raided, and then we want to trade into an imbalance as a clear draw on liquidity. If you find it easier to spot external range to internal range, you can just stick with it like that. You can also go from internal range to external range, which could be an optimal trade entry right into a range on a fair value gap, and then aiming for an old low or an old high. You don't ever have to trade internal range to external range, and the same goes for those of you who can see internal range to external range. The important thing is what is most comfortable for you to see.

### Summary

Internal to external range liquidity. The relationship between the two being used on the monthly, weekly, daily, and the 4-hour chart is the key that unlocks your understanding to bias and builds the anticipatory skills required to forecast market direction and where price most likely will move.

One of the biggest misconceptions regarding low resistance liquidity runs is that they are only fragile patterns on the chart, like trend lines or equal highs or equal lows. That kind of pattern is valid. However, true low resistance liquidity runs are framed off the higher time frame price delivery arrays (PDAs). Think about monthly levels, weekly levels, weekly fair value gaps, and so on. The higher time frame monthly, weekly, and daily charts are the catalyst to one-sided low resistance liquidity runs occurring in the marketplace.
