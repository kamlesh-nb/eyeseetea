In this next lesson, we're going to be talking about order pairing. In the previous lesson, we discussed internal and external range liquidity. This concept is key to understanding order pairing. 

### What is Order Pairing?

Order pairing involves understanding the liquidity requirements that smart money needs for their orders: where they get in and where they get out of positions. This fundamental understanding is crucial for trusting the market to deliver to specific levels and understanding why it reaches for those levels. 

Have you ever had moments where you believed price was going to reach a certain level, but you abandoned the trade just for the price to eventually get to your desired location? This urge to exit the market during a retracement, thinking itâ€™s reversing, reflects a lack of understanding of liquidity requirements and how market makers engineer liquidity for their order pairing.

Using time frame alignments, we can:
- Use a monthly PD array with a daily structure
- Use a weekly PD array with a 4-hour structure
- Use a daily PD array with a 1-hour structure
- Use a 4-hour PD array with a 15-minute structure

Price is fractal. If you're a swing trader, you're better off using a monthly or a weekly PD array with a daily or 4-hour structure. If you're an intraday trader, you should trade daily PD arrays with a 1-hour structure. If you're a scalper or short-term trader, a 4-hour PD array with a 15-minute structure is sufficient. It depends on your personality: swing traders might prefer higher time frames, while scalpers or intraday traders should go with daily or 4-hour PD arrays and their structures.

### Smart Money Involvement

Smart money is involved in moves on the monthly, weekly, and daily time frames, but not in lower time frames because their orders are too large. When they are bullish, they accumulate their orders below old lows, and when they are bearish, they accumulate their sells above old highs. Trading off higher time frame levels is crucial; otherwise, you are gambling.

### British Pound/Canadian Dollar Monthly Chart

Look at the British Pound/Canadian Dollar monthly chart. We observe bearish order flow, a massive rejection wick, and internal and external range liquidity. After hitting internal range liquidity on a monthly time frame, price aims for the external range. 

Zooming in on a daily structure, we see monthly levels annotated. There is a monthly fair value gap and buy stops on the monthly time frame. In the daily structure, where should order pairing happen? If you identified the low as external range liquidity, you are correct. Smart money pairs their buys with sell stops, accumulating orders where willing sellers enter the market.

### Engineering Liquidity

Smart money engineers liquidity through retracements and failure swings, forming liquidity pools that provide opportunities to enter the market. This is exemplified by the British Pound/Canadian Dollar daily chart where smart money accumulates orders below old lows and pushes price up to offload their long positions above old highs. Retracements provide opportunities to get into the market aiming for external range liquidity.

### Lower Time Frame Order Pairing

Higher time frame internal to external range liquidity transitions to lower time frame order pairing. For example, on a 1-hour chart, smart money pairs their orders with willing sellers' sell stops. They accumulate long positions below old lows and push prices higher, engineering liquidity with failure swings.

### Australian Dollar/US Dollar Analysis

On the Australian Dollar/US Dollar daily chart, after taking out buy stops, price retraces into internal range liquidity. Smart money engineers liquidity by forming failure swings. This process continues from external to internal ranges, creating opportunities to enter short positions in premium levels and targeting engineered liquidity.

### Conclusion

Higher time frame analysis from internal to external ranges transitions into lower time frame order pairing. Understanding this process helps identify key levels for smart money's entry and exit points, providing higher probability trade opportunities.

Order pairing involves:
- Monthly charts transitioning to daily structures
- Weekly PD arrays aligning with 4-hour structures
- Daily PD arrays used with 1-hour structures
- 4-hour PD arrays with 15-minute structures

By understanding and identifying these key levels and how smart money engineers liquidity, traders can align their trades with market direction and liquidity targets.
