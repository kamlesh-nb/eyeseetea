Now that we went over our first lesson about the Power of Three, let's move on to the second lesson, which is about failure swings and low resistance liquidity.

First of all, what is a failure swing? A failure swing is a swing high that fails to take out another swing high or a swing low that fails to take out another swing low. This is low resistance liquidity, and we want to see this form on the up-closing side of our structure.

For instance, when we are bullish, we want to see a bearish failure swing. A bearish failure swing is a high that fails to take out a previous high. When we are bearish, we want to see a bullish failure swing. A bullish failure swing is a low that fails to take out a previous low. The market will usually go through opposing failure swings with ease, like a hot knife cutting through butter.

Now we covered low resistance liquidity, let's talk about high resistance liquidity. We want to see this form on the opposing side of our structure. A low that ran a previous low and rejected is a high resistance low, and a high that ran a previous high and then rejects is a high resistance high. We'll use this logic on all time frames.

Over here, we have a crude depiction of a market maker buy model. We've got our draw liquidity up here, our structure, and our discount array. Think about where we want to see those failure swings form. When we are bullish, we want to see those bearish failure swings, which is a high that fails to take out another high. 

Over here, we've got multiple failure swings. We have a high over here, which this high fails to take out. Then over here, we've got this little trend line going on, which is a set of failure swings. This high fails to take out this high, and this high over here fails to take out this high. Down here, we've got even more: a high, a lower high, and even a lower highâ€”all failure swings around here.

Once we hit that discount array and we've got a low formed over here, we want to be targeting those failure swings as our draw on liquidity. Why is that our draw on liquidity? This is low resistance liquidity. We always want to go for that low resistance liquidity.

What do we want to see form on our side of the structure? High resistance liquidity. We know it's rejecting that low and we want to go bullish, so we don't want to see those lows ran again. Over here, we have that high resistance low because we run that previous low and then reject immediately. This is a good confirmation that we're heading into bullish order flow.

I always say high resistance liquidity runs happen on the opposing side of our order flow. Once we are bullish, every low that gets ran and rejected is probably a high resistance liquidity run, and the market will struggle to go below those lows when we are bullish.

Once we are bullish again from the discount array, we want to target those failure swings, that low resistance liquidity. Once we're in discount, we want to draw into premium. If we have that low resistance liquidity in our discount range already, then it's even better to draw into premium and take out that low resistance liquidity.

Over here, we have the inverse. This is a market maker sell model. We've got our premium array up here and our draw on liquidity again down here. What do we want to focus on? We want to focus on that low resistance liquidity. Where is that forming? Again, those failure swings. Those lows that fail to take out another low are over here. We've got a little trend line down here with multiple lows that failed to take out the previous low, even down here at our draw on liquidity and over here.

Once we hit that higher time frame premium array, we want to see that smart money reversal happen, that change in order flow. But we want to see a high resistance liquidity run first so we know that on our side of the structure and confirm our order flow. 

How does that look? We have this high which gets ran and then rejects immediately. If that happens, we have good confirmation we're going into bearish order flow. Now we can see all these lows, these failure swings, and they are all still in premium, which makes it even better if we want to draw at least into discount and eventually target down lower.

Over here, we've got another high resistance liquidity run, and then it rejects immediately. Again, on our side of the structure, we want to see those high resistance liquidity runs happen so we know these highs are probably going to stay intact and we're going to continue down in our draw on liquidity. 

Those failure swings, which we have down here, are still in premium over here. Then we draw back down into discount levels, taking all those low resistance liquidity lows down here and also down here eventually until we reach that draw on liquidity.

Over here, we've got a mini S&P 500 futures chart. Let's look at where the discount and premium levels are. We've got this low down here for our discount and this high up here for our premium levels. Think about that low resistance again. Where are the failure swings forming? We've got those failure swings down here. This is low resistance liquidity and a nice target where we can draw into.

Notice how these failure swings are in premium. Once we go from premium into discount and those failure swings are still in premium, we've got that engineered liquidity down here. Those failure swings will cut through like a hot knife through butter, right back into discount over here, which we can see as that daily discount fair value gap which was the draw on liquidity after we draw into bearish order flow.

Low resistance liquidity up here has been liquidated, and we hit that discount fair value gap in discount. 

How does that look on an intraday chart for the E-mini S&P 500? We have that one-hour chart over here. Think back about that market maker buy model we covered earlier. This is the same kind of schematic, only with candlesticks. We've got our draw on liquidity on the highs and then our higher time frame discount array, which in this case is that daily discount fair value gap.

Over here, we have that high resistance liquidity run against order flow. It rejects that low immediately and starts to go into bullish order flow. Notice where the failure swings are. We've got all these failure swings up here, which is low resistance liquidity. Also, notice how this is still in discount levels because the premium is about around here. We want to move up into that draw on liquidity, which is up here, and then target all that low resistance liquidity, all those failure swings up here and then eventually up here on a draw on liquidity.

Over here, we've got our Euro USD monthly chart. Let's see where our premium and discount levels are. From this swing high up here into this swing low down here, we've got our whole dealing range. Everything up here is in premium, and everything down here is in discount. 

What did we hit recently? We hit a higher time frame PD. We've got this monthly premium fair value gap, a perfect area where we can reject from, and on the lower time frame, we can scout for an opportunity to get into a sell. 

Let's go to the daily chart. Over here, we have that Euro USD daily chart. Remember, we hit that higher time frame bearish array, that monthly premium fair value gap. Over here, we've got some nice structure. 

What do we want to see when we want to sell? We want to see a high resistance liquidity run, which confirms we are going into bearish order flow. How does that look? Over here, we've got that high resistance liquidity run. It's a swing high that takes out another swing high and then immediately rejects price action. 

We can see over here it fails to take out this high once again, so it starts to trade lower and lower. Now we want to target that low resistance liquidity. Where is that forming? Over here, we've got all these lows forming, which is a failure swing again. Over here, it fails to take out these lows and these lows. Over here, we've got some relative equal lows, a very good draw on liquidity, which we call low resistance liquidity.

Where does an opportunity lie to go into these lows? We're scouting for a premium array once again. What is available on the chart right now? We've got that volume imbalance up here, a good area to take a sell from. You can actually see how willing price action is to go through those low resistance liquidity lows, those failure swings. 

You can see here price action goes down with ease, and that's the whole point of that low resistance liquidity.
