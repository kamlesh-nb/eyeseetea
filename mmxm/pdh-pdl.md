Let's go on to our third lesson for this mentorship. It's going to be about previous days' highs and lows.

Previous days' highs and lows will be the easiest draw on liquidity for you. Think about it: every single day, you can see the daily candle reaching for the previous daily high or the previous daily low. This is the easiest liquidity pool in the market. There is rarely an inside bar, as we call it, and we’ll show you on the next chart how that looks. In bullish order flow, the market will always seek buy-side liquidity above previous daily highs, and in bearish order flow, the market will seek sell-side liquidity below previous day's lows. Previous days' highs and lows are one of the foundations of daily bias and the draw on liquidity. It's the easiest liquidity pool the market will attack almost every single day.

Now let's look at this next chart. We've got a daily chart for GBP/USD. We can see an old daily low over here, and sell stops have been liquidated. Our higher time frame target has been hit over here, now expanding higher and higher. Let's look at all the candles on this chart. Do you see a candle that is an inside bar? I can show you one if I have to look for it. I think this one did not take out the high of the previous day, so this is what we call an inside bar. But look at all the other candles: almost every candle takes out a previous daily high or a previous daily low. Over here, it takes out the high and the low, which is an indication of a reversal, but we'll cover that later. Over here, we take out the low; over here, we take out the low again; over here, both sides have been taken. This one takes the high, this one takes the high, this one takes the low, and so on. 

90% of all these candles take out the previous daily high or low and will liquidate a daily liquidity pool. Now, looking at after we rate those sell stops on the daily time frame, this daily low down here, what is the next target? We have an imbalance over here that could be repriced, and we also have some relative equal highs up here, which is a good draw on liquidity. So now, what do we wait for? How do we get there, and when do we engage? That's a topic for another section. But looking at all those previous daily highs and lows, that will be the easiest draw on liquidity.

Outlining these highs over here, these are all buy stops. Remember, we already took out this long-term low down here. Over here, we've got this smart money reversal, and then look at every previous daily high. This previous daily high gets rated easily. This one gets rated, creating a small wick on the bottom, going up, taking out this high, and then eventually breaking structure over here. So, buy-side liquidity pools are seemingly getting taken out, and we can assume bullish order flow is coming in. 

Now, let's annotate a break of structure right over here. This was the last swing high in this down move, and it got taken out by this big bullish candle. This is significant because we already took out this old daily low. Remember, if this low was still intact, and let's say this candle and these candles were just slightly above here, you would still have to think about this low being rated again. If we take out this high, we might just have a high resistance liquidity run. So, this is important: this low getting rated before we break this structure means there are no orders left on the sell side to return back into. 

Now, with this displacement over here, what do we form? We have a daily fair value gap inside here after a break of structure. Again, importantly, this sell-side raid down here sets up a nice narrative to take buys, and order flow has changed to bullish instead of bearish. Again, outlining previous daily highs, now we hit that discount array, which is a daily fair value gap after that break of structure. We dip into that, and then we can look to target previous daily highs. This low didn’t get rated; we have an inside bar over here. Continuing up, taking out buy stops over here, taking out buy stops at the previous daily high over here, again and again. 

Now, on an intraday chart, which is a 1-hour chart on the British pound against the US dollar, we have that break of structure right here on the daily time frame. We have this blue box, which is that daily fair value gap. Again, think about these lows down here: sell-side liquidity has been rated. After that break of structure, we can assume order flow is going into bullish order flow. Always outline your New York midnight lines: 12 a.m. EST Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Now we know where we are in the week. Also, Monday trades up, Tuesday trades up. Look at these highs: there are kind of relative equal highs, so it could be a buy-side liquidity pool. Now we dip back into that daily fair value gap, which is a higher time frame discount array. So, it makes sense if we break up structure from here. Over here, we're breaking structure up here, rating this short-term low down here, back once again into the daily fair value gap. We also have a tiny little fair gap down here and then continue up. Order flow is good to go into previous daily highs. So, buy-side liquidity pool over here, buy-side liquidity pool over here, over here, and over here.

Zooming in a little bit more, outlining that New York midnight price. Dipping below New York and reversing, going for previous daily highs. Again, this is key every time. If you trade below the daily or the New York midnight opening price, create a low of the day either in the London session or with a New York reversal profile. We can expect previous daily highs to get rated every time. If you are confident in your analysis that we are in the daily time frame bullish order flow, only look for those previous daily highs. Always mark those out on your chart. The most essential things to have on your chart are that vertical line to separate the days from 12:00 a.m. New York time, the New York midnight price line, and previous daily highs and previous daily lows, as those are the easiest liquidity pools in the market.

How do these candles look? Let's go to the next slide. We can see the daily candles look like this, and this is a very good indication we’re still in bullish order flow. We've got slightly a bullish reversal candle over here, which we covered in the previous lesson with the power of three, right? A little bit of a longer wick on the bottom but closing out bullish after importantly hitting a daily fair value gap. The next day is also a buy day. Then we are in the next week, which is on Monday, also a buy day. Then you have to think about what time of the week you are in, obviously. But we still got a bearish candle, but order flow is still bullish. You cannot have 20 bullish candles in a row; there has to be some sort of retracement or a slow move lower. Then you can have a bearish candle too, but remember, order flow is still bullish. We've got these nice highs over here. Even though this candle closes bullish, think about that liquidity pool above market price, which is the previous daily high.

Now, we have a daily chart on the DXY, or the US dollar currency index. This will be the scenario for bearish order flow, which will target previous daily lows. There is a higher time frame array up here, a premium level that got hit. I assume this is a daily fair value gap. Going down lower and breaking structure down here, we've got confirmed sell-side of the curve incoming. Over here, every time we take out more buy-side, we take out previous daily highs again and again until we reach that higher time frame array. Now, breaking structure lower and returning back into that daily fair value gap. This is the same as what happened on the bullish order flow we just covered, but this is on the sell-side of the curve. Now we hit that bearish daily fair value gap, and we can see the market is targeting every time this previous daily lows. Marking out your previous daily lows again, this one gets taken out, this one gets taken out, this last swing low after that break of structure gets taken out again. Previous daily low, previous daily low, previous daily low. Very easy liquidity pool to get targeted when you are in bearish order flow.

Let's look at this intraday chart, a 1-hour chart. Daily fair value gap hit higher time frame, continuing bearish order flow. Outline your previous daily lows every time. That's the liquidity pool trading lower during the week. This is a Friday. Let me outline this New York midnight open price. Every time we trade above it and then start to decline, trade above it and start to decline, over here the same situation: trade above New York midnight price, decline, and it goes on and on until every time we take out these previous daily lows. When the Asia range is very large, you don't necessarily have to trade above the New York midnight price, but over here, the Asia range is quite small and ideal to trade above the New York midnight price.

How do the daily candles look if we utilize this? All bearish candles. Most importantly, do we hit a higher time frame array? Yes, we did. That daily fair value gap, that bearish daily fair value gap, and then we start to break structure lower, outlining the previous daily lows, an easy draw on liquidity, and all the daily candles will close bearish.
