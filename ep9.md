All right, folks. Welcome back! This is episode 9 for the 2022 ICT Mentorship on YouTube. This lecture is going to be on Power 3, which is Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution, and New York PM Session Opportunities.

All right, so we're looking at the Nasdaq E-mini futures. This is the continuous chart on TradingView. If you look at the daily range where we've been, we're inside this range here. 

Okay, so we have this swing high and this swing low. Now, why am I picking these two reference points? Well, namely, this is the low most recently after taking out this short-term low. So we've dug into all the sell-side liquidity resting below that low. We retraced back up inside of this high to that low. 

So, we went back up into a premium. The range high to low, running a fib just to get the 50% level, gives us equilibrium. Anything below that is a discount. Notice how the market traded down on Monday into a deep discount but did not take out these lows over here. 

But look how we closed on Monday. We had an indecisive candle. The body was basically absent; the opening and close were essentially the same thing. If we have that and the market is trading down into a discount, even though we might have a low down here that we're targeting, this may require a retracement. 

Now, notice at the close of Monday's trading, we had an imbalance from this low and this high. On Tuesday's trading overnight, the equities markets had a run-up into this imbalance here. So, this fair value gap was retreated to in here. This low and this high will look at that in reference to the lower time frames. 

This lower level is the low end of the fair value gap on a daily chart, and this level up here is the upper end of the fair value gap. I'm taking your attention to Monday's trading, and I want to talk a little bit about Power 3, which is Accumulation, Distribution, and Manipulation. 

Okay, so generally my teachings are like this: if I'm bullish, I'm expecting the opening price to be near the low of the day or the session. Then it trades lower, making some important low, and then rallies, creates a high, and then closes near the high of the day. 

Now, it's not important for you to try to predict the closing price. What I'm trying to train you to anticipate is the likelihood of the market making some kind of a fake move, like a Judas swing. 

Okay, a Judas swing is the false move. Typically, in the London and New York sessions, there are fake runs that start off a move. I walked you through it last week on my community tab where I outlined the actual Judas swing for that particular day using the fair value gap. I outlined the low; I was only off by a quarter of a point for the low end of the range, and it created the low of the day. The idea is what I'm going to show you here as well on Monday.
